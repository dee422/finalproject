    <p>This is a webpage that documents the past and present lives of a cat through images, all generated by AI.</p>

    <p>Cats are often considered one of humanity's best friends, and for good reason. They have been domesticated for thousands of years, providing companionship and aiding in pest control. One piece of evidence that supports this claim is the fact that cats have been known to form strong emotional bonds with their human owners, similar to those between dogs and humans. Studies have shown that cats can recognize their owner's voice and respond positively to it. Additionally, cats have been found to be effective therapy animals, helping individuals cope with mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. Their presence alone can provide a sense of comfort and relaxation, making them an invaluable asset to many people's lives.</p>
